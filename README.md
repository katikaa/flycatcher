## SHORT DESCRIPTION
Flycatcher is an interactive application intending to fill travel time in a plane by helping passengers discover areas they fly above. Aimed at nervous flyers & families travelling with children, Flycatcher uses maps & NASA data to educate & entertain.

## CHALLENGE
To build a tool that will allow pilots and passengers to identify geographic, natural, and cultural locations of interest along their flight path.
## BACKGROUND
8 million people fly every day. 1 out of 3 is a nervous flyer. Some of them are first time flyers and among them you will find lots of families travelling with small children. Our application aims to provide a solution to all those who ever wondered: What am I going to do during this travel time?
Instead of treating your flight journey as idle time, discover: Flycatcher
## PRODUCT:
Flycatcher is a GPS-based interactive application that utilises modern technology and a variety of NASA data to provide information to passengers on the areas they fly above.
## SPEC:
Flycatcher is an application available to passengers’ phones. Utilises GPS to fetch location-based APIs and display useful information.
We have built a 2D map in a 3D visualisation landscape that moves as device’s latlongs change.
In our example, our algorithm searches a radius of 100km around passenger’s location (real-time) to display information about the biggest city in that area. Information varies between interesting facts to most popular activities according to Wikitravel.
## ROADMAP:
Personalise it – allow passengers to save their progress against their e-mail address or flight number and seat.
Gamification – create country quizzes that passengers can attempt to solve. We reward engagement by giving them awards they can unlock. Awards can vary from points to vouchers in the next flight with the same carrier.
News discovery – passengers discover local news they would not normally come across otherwise
Educate – passengers can learn words or popular recipes for the countries they fly above. They can also discover famous landmarks and observe their changes within years.
